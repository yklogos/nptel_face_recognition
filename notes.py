                            2. IIT M Particle Characterization (PG)
                            3. IIT KGP Cloud Computing
                            
                        2. garbage words detected with profs name(eg. dr. a. kushari ds eer eet..):
                            1. IIT K (channel)Aerospace Engineering
                            2. IIT B Introduction to Mechanobiology, Introduction To Proteomics
                        
                    1. current method: 
                        1. check in title at the end of paylist name

                        5. if honorific not found ret None
                    
                2. on swayam site: <div, class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> tag 
                    
                    
        3. image:
            1. image extraction in vedios:
                1. problems: 
                    1. completely wrong image eg. prof. meenakshi dâ€™souza

                    3. dark face detected not recognised

                2. if not found in first vedio how to change search parameters:
                    1. options: increase time duration, frames searched per sec for vedio
                        
            2. check quality, suitable for face recognition, of extarcted image:
                1. currently only checking brightness
                2. problems specific to face recognition eg. frontal image, eyes closed
                
            3. TODO: get many images for 1 professor for different lighting conditions, moods and emotional states
